# Algorithm Visualizer (WIP)
---
*The code in this project is all my own work and This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

This is an interactive project that allows the user to select a start and end point, select an algorithm and visually experience how the algorithm finds the shortest path.
